The original dataset used for this project has been obtained from the Office of national statistics. It contains data on all of the 
registered suicides in England from 1981-2021. A copy of the original dataset, along with the original codebook, can be found in the 
“data” file of this collection. The original file also contains information on how suicides were registered. 
For this visualisation, I have saved Table 4 of this data set as a CSV, which is called 'raw_data' in my Rscript. 

The variables from the original data set used in the present visualisation were collated into a data frame called ‘df1’, 
these variables included: 

Sex: biological sex of the victim of suicide. Levels are: Males, Females and Persons (mean for both males and females)

Area: The region of England with mean data for all regions added as an additional variable. 
Levels are: North East, North West, Yorkshire and The Humber, East Midlands, West Midlands, East, London, South East, South West, 
Mean for all regions. 

year : The year ranging from 1981 to 2021. Levels are: one entry for each year for each area. 

rates_per_100k: This is the age standardised suicide rate per 100,000 and is scale data.
